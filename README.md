# YoN: Yes or No

YoN: Yes or No is a decision-making tool, similar to flipping a coin. It's free and simple to use, based on true randomness, and is a fun way to decide between two options, or to play with your friends!

YoN uses [Random.org](https://www.random.org/) to generate true random numbers, which are then used to determine the outcome of the decision.
